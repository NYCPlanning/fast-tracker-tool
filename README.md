# Fast Tracker Tool

## Description
The Fast Tracker screening tool is intended to facilitate discussions among prospective applicants and applicable lead agencies for CEQR Type II eligibility pursuant to the [Green Fast Track for Housing](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/green-fast-track/green-fast-track-overview.page) regulations. Type II actions are those that will not have a significant impact on the environment as determined by certain criteria established by SEQRA and are therefore exempted from further environmental review. To qualify, projects must meet certain location and density criteria, and Fast Tracker will provide screenings as well as guide applicants to resources where additional information must be provided to the lead agency.

NYC Planning welcomes feedback on Fast Tracker to improve its accuracy and usability. If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues while using the survey, [please send us feedback](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7821882/GFT-Fast-Tracker-Feedback). Your input is valuable as we strive to enhance our services. NYC Planning will not keep a copy of your survey report until it is formally submitted to us for eligibility review.
